## About

My project tries to be a some sort of clone for twitter. Main idea is that users can post tweets, comment them and like them. This is also the only implemented feature, and other features like, chat, friends,... will be probably added later.
I have created several users beforehand and with these you can only go through login.

| Email | Password | 
|----------|----------|
| rii@example.com | rii |
| ree@example.com | ree | 
| jarmo@example.com | jarmo | 

>[!NOTE]
>Server shutdowns itself when being unused -> loading during the login might take a while, about 2-4min
>
>Due to the entityes attribute changes in database, interactions between some users might not work
